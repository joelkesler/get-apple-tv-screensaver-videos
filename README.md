# get-apple-tv-screensaver-videos
A short terminal command to download all the 1080p time-lapse screensaver footage from the late 2015 AppleTV.  Uses wget (use brew or macports to install if you don't have it) and its resumable downloads feature, so you can run this script when new screensavers are released without redownloading the videos you already have.
